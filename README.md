# Code-Refactor-Homework-1
## Descrption
This is our first homework project websit for Horiseon Marketing.

My priorpity is to rewrite the codes for the Horiseion website to make sure the entire site is presented propperly and functions intuitively as the user intended. In order to do so, I have optimized the CSS styling sheet by consilodating some of the redundant codes. Then I made comments to all css codes to help my end user understand and easy-navigate the stylings in the background. I have corrected the html semantics to match all coorelated css stylings.

A link to the deployed website is [link="https://ronin1702.github.io/Code-Refactor/"]
